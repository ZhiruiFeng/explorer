Alan Newell and Herbert Simon described problem solving as a search that occurs between the posing of the problem and its solution, which represents an approach to problem solving is providing a way to specify the possible pathways from the initial to goal states. In cognitive psychological fields, this is called Information-Processing approach.

This repository tries explore the typical AI topics of problem solving, reasoning, planning and decision making through searching methods.
